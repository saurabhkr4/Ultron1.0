<b>Regarding Bubble Sort:</b>
In the given bubble sort program we are sorting 5 integers which are stored in registers x27 to x31. The sorted integers are stored in the registers x18 to x22 after running the file.

The <b>unsorted array</b> is stored in the registers from <b>x27</b> to <b>x31</b>
The <b>sorted array</b> is stored in the registers from <b>x18</b> to <b>x22</b>




<b>How to use</b>

**Step 1: From the main branch, Run guiwithlogic.py file**

**Step 2: Click on the Bubble Sort Button**

Along with BubbleSort.asm, also try running sumofTenNaturalNumbers.asm and LoadStorecheck.asm

Phase I:
Highlights of the Project in Previous Phase:- 

•	13 Instructions executed – 
1)	ADD
2)	SUB
3)	MUL
4)	ADDI
5)	SUBI
6)	MULI
7)	LW
8)	SW
9)	BEQ
10)	BNE
11)	BGE
12)	BLT
13)	JAL

•	3 Programs in . asm format are attached in repo-
1)	 BubbleSort.asm
2)	sumofTenNaturalNumbers.asm
3)	LoadStorecheck.asm

•	User Friendly Interface made using Tkinter which enables show output in Binary, HexaDecimal and Decimal systems
•	The  Outputs of the registers are visible in the GUI, while the  memory Elements are visible in Terminal

•	Simulator code written in an easy to interpret language- Python!



Phase II:
Highlights of the Project in this Phase:- 
•	It diagrammatically shows the pipeline flow of the code in the terminal.
•	User can see the output of pipeline diagram in both – Forwarding and Non-Forwarding mode (in terminal).
•	It gives the count of Clock Cycles in Forwarding and Non-Forwarding mode.
•	It Tells the gives the count of Stalls in Forwarding and Non-Forwarding mode.
•	It prints the memory elements after execution of the Program.
•	5 Programs in . asm format are attached in repo-
o	 BubbleSort.asm
o	sumofTenNaturalNumbers.asm
o	LoadStorecheck.asm
o	SpecialStall.asm
o	addreg.asm

Possible Further Improvements:
•	We couldn’t completely add the pipelining in Tkinter GUI, hence in a proper presentable manner, we have implemented it in Terminal only. This can be improved
•	Single Line Implementation can be added

The Backend part was done by Pranav.
The Frontend part and linking of Frontend with Backend was done by Saurabh.

Thanks!
Team Ultron.
